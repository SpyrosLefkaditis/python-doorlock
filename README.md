Raspberry Pi Python Locking System
This GitHub repository presents a Python-based locking system designed for Raspberry Pi, featuring servo motor control. The lock_system.py script, initially crafted for Raspberry Pi utilizing RPi.GPIO library, has been adapted for simulation on Wokwi using Arduino components.

The simulation, accessible via Wokwi's online platform, provides a virtual environment to observe the servo motor's locking and unlocking actions. This enables users to experiment with the functionality before deploying it on physical Raspberry Pi hardware.

Access the simulation on Wokwi to replace the code and run simulations.



This serves as a demonstration for users interested in experimenting with the concept before deploying it on physical Raspberry Pi hardware. Link in wokwi to replace the code and run simulation https://wokwi.com/projects/302096915797901833
